# Python-pathfinder
The A* pathfinding algorithm I coded in python,
I used the euclidian score system with the corner neighboors.

Basically, the algorithm will search the shortest path between the A and B squares.

Click on the color square on the bottom left to cycle the types of actions :
make/remove walls, move starting point, move ending point.
Then click the pathfind button to let the algorithm work,
and after it's done you'll need to hit pathfind again to edit the grid again.
The grid will also be saved.

Instruction : download the zip file and uncompress it, then run '__main__.py' with python3, pygame and numpy.
